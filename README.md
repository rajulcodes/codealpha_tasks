# 📁 CodeAlpha Task Submissions - July Batch

Welcome to my submission for the **CodeAlpha July Batch Task Program**! This repository contains four Python-based mini-projects demonstrating core programming skills such as file handling, string manipulation, regular expressions, conditionals, and basic user interaction. Each task is self-contained and serves a practical utility.
